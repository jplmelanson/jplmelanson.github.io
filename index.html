<!-- ============================ ABOUT ============================ -->
<h1>About</h1>
<hr />
<p>I'm a software craftsman, currently working in the entertainment biz, but I do some consulting part time. I'm an engineer at heart and like to promote values such as competency, work ethic, responsibility and engagement. You can reach me (g.m.a.i.l, twitter, github) with my handle <a href="https://twitter.com/jplmelanson" target="_blank"><i>@jplmelanson</i></a></p>
<!-- ============================ INTERESTS ============================ -->
<h1>Interests</h1>
<hr />
<p>I've been doing web and backend development for several years on systems where non-functional requirements were critical (performance, security, resiliency, reliability, etc...) While I still have interest in this kind of applications, I'm also open to learn new things, like mobile development, new technology stacks like Rails, recommendation engines, deployment automation with chef, handling big data with MapReduce and NoSQL.</p>
<!-- ============================ SKILLS ============================ -->
<h1>Expertise</h1>
<hr />
<br />
<h2>Java</h2>
<p>I have strong fundamentals in java development skills. I have my OCPJP certification (ex-SCJP) with Java 1.6, but like to keep up-to-date with what happens in v7 and v8. Threading, Garbage collections, Collections, Generics, IO handling. Advanced knowledge of Spring framework (core, beans, context, aop, jms, integration), hibernate, jpa, ejb, jmx, jms, jsf, asynchronous processing, web services, rest services</p>
<h2>Web</h2>
<p>I have good knowledge of web technologies: HTML, CSS, HTTP, WebSockets, SSL, API design, REST principles</p>
<h2>Javascript</h2>
<p>I've done my part of javascript coding in the past, way before ajax became a buzzword. I can work with any framework or create OO javascript myself (I created many JSF component renderers in the past). I've also had my hands on some Node.JS experiments. I've recently played a bit with KnockoutJS, AngularJS, and Express.
</p>
<h2>Software Configuration Management</h2>
<p>I've been promoting good software configuration management practices in every project I've been working on. I've developed a strong expertise with continous integration, code quality tooling, developer productivity (IDE and automation) and system validation and verification.</p>
<h2>Linux</h2>
<p>I've been working with linux for several years as my main working OS. I have a good knowledge of its architecture and tools (grep, ssh, telnet, /etc, netstat, etc...)</p>
<h2>Scala</h2>
<p>I have written capacity and performance tests with a scala framework once and fall in love with the language. I did pursue language learning through online tutorials and guides. I would be glad to work with it full time.</p>
<h2>Software architecture and design</h2>
<p>I can do system design, component design, service design with OO and FP languages. Good knowledge of SOA, cloud computing, multi-tier and unix-like architectural patterns. I have good fundamentals of hardware engineering and can adjust design decision to hardware and business requirements.</p>
<h2>Scripting</h2>
<p>I've done scripts in bash, groovy, scala, javascript, perl, ruby.</p>

  var _gaq = _gaq || [];
  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-42980863-1']);
