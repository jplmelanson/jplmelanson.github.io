<h1>About</h1>
<p>I'm a software craftsman, currently working in the entertainment biz, but I do some consulting part time. I'm an engineer at heart and like to promote values such as competency, work ethic, responsibility and engagement. You can reach me (g.m.a.i.l, twitter, github) with my handle @jplmelanson.</p>

<p>I can help you with my skills:
<ul>
  <li><b>java</b>&nbsp;:&nbsp;I have strong fundamentals in java development skills. I have my OCPJP certification (ex-SCJP) with Java 1.6, but like to keep up-to-date with what happens in v7 and v8. Threading, Garbage collections, Collections, Generics, IO handling.</li>
<li><b>enterprise java</b>&nbsp;:&nbsp;Advanced knowledge of Spring framework (core, beans, context, aop, jms, integration), hibernate, ejb, jmx, jms, jsf, asynchronous processing, web services, rest services</li>
<li><b>web</b>: I have good knowledge of the web: HTML, CSS, HTTP, WebSockets, SSL</li>
<li><b>javascript</b>&nbsp;:&nbsp;I've done my part of javascript coding, way before ajax became a buzzword. I can work with many frameworks or create OO javascript myself (I created many JSF component renderers in the past). I've also had my hands on some Node.JS experiments.</li>
<li><b>linux</b>&nbsp;:&nbsp;I've been working with linux for several years as my main working OS. I have a good knowledge of its architecture and tools (grep, ssh, telnet, /etc, netstat, etc...)</li>
<li><b>scala</b>&nbsp;:&nbsp;I have written capacity and performance tests with a scala framework once and fall in love with the language. I did pursue language learning through online tutorials and guides. I would be glad to work with it full time.</li>
<li><b>architecture</b>&nbsp;:&nbsp;I can do system design, component design, service design with OO and FP languages. Good knowledge of SOA, cloud computing, multi-tier and unix-like architectural patterns. I have good fundamentals of hardware engineering and can adjust design decision to hardware requirements.</li>
